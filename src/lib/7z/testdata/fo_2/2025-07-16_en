I have been working on the backend for the past two months, and there are relatively few frontend things. Basically, there are two, one is "forward", "backward", and the other is "register".

Forward and back are what I had before, and now they are coordinated with the forward and back buttons of the browser. For example, I am doing some operations now. Then, I can go back,forward,... You can press the forward and back buttons of the browser, like this. If you can press the forward and back buttons of the browser, just press the mouse, because there are usually "forward" and "backward" buttons on the side of the mouse, which is very convenient. I am still very proud of this improvement.

Then the most important thing is registration. You see, it is actually some very basic but quite trivial form validation. It will tell you that the username cannot be empty and the password must be more than eight characters. Then, I will enter a random repeated password here, and then it will tell you that this is different from the password above... It is to do some basic checks. For example, I am now entering a username "wang", and it has a path name here, and the password is eight characters, and then it is checked. After checking, you can see that it actually wants these three. Then I click here, and it registers. Then you can see what this "path name" means, it changes here. The path becomes "/wang". The backend database, you see, I just registered this. Then, if I check it again, it will tell you that the path name must be unique. I just registered "wang" and I can't register it again. It will tell you. Then, for example,you can change it to "wang_1", and then check it again, it will pass. After passing, you register again, and you can see that there is one more data in the database here. This is the registration process. This is actually quite simple, but quite trivial, just some basic error checks.

Then there are styles, dark and light, mainly the previous content, and there are some small improvements this time.

Then, the place where I was stuck these two days is when you changed a login account. It is actually not called a user account, it should be a folder. I will show you later that it actually corresponds to a folder behind it. So each user can register multiple folders. It actually changes a batch of data. You see, the browser history is like this: "/wang_1", and then "/wang",and then the root path "/". But as I just said, my history is not linear. For example, I divide a sub-window here, and the sub-windowdivides another sub-window, and then this sub-window can move forward and backward independently, like this, and the upper window also has forward and backward, see, it is like this. So it is different from the forward and backward of the browser, the forward and backward of the browser is a line, so this will cause misalignment. If you are always the same account, for example, you are always "wang", then it doesn't matter if it is not aligned. But, for example, if I retreat all the way to the outermost layer now, and then back off,to the very end, when I reach the very outermost layer, there is nowhere left to retreat, do you see? But there are still a few "wang_1" here, so if you retreat again, it will be a no-op, right, that's it. But, when you retreat to this point, you will switch to the previous account,right. So all the data has changed. So it must be aligned, especially when switching accounts, because when you switch accounts, a batch of data will be changed. So it must be aligned... I still need to think about how to do this. This is still quite confusing, but it is not complicated.

Then the others are some basic, previous things. I have been constantly polishing and improving them, but they are all small things, such as... currently, it only has vertical scrolling, it is in wrap mode, that is, it will soft return, it has no horizontal scrolling. Then if I change it to non-wrap mode, right, then, you see, it has horizontal scrolling, because some lines exceed, it will have a horizontal scroll bar. Horizontal scrolling is to press shift to scroll, and it scrolls vertically when you scroll normally. Then, I mainly want to demonstrate this. That is, you scroll horizontally when you scroll normally, and you scroll vertically when you press shift to scroll. These are some small improvements in horizontal and vertical layout.

That's it. There are small errors and flaws from time to time during the development process, which need to be constantly corrected and improved.

Next, I will add a "Settings" pop-up window to each item, which can set wrap, non-wrap, horizontal, vertical, and left-to-right or right-to-left. Then, another very important thing is that each item has a creation time, modification time, and a review time. These should also be adjustable, because for example, if you want to organize the previous things, my previous things are all timestamped, so when you add them,you can adjust the modification time and so on. If all these are listed, they will not fit in the status bar. A button should be added, and then a dialog box should be popped up, and then you can set it there. And more importantly, there is another setting to set whether it is public. Doesn't every account have a website? You can make some content public, and then others can visit this website and see the public content. Of course, you can also set it to be visible to someone if you know its username. In fact, these are not difficult. The basic framework has been out, and forms, pop-up windows, buttons, etc. can be added as needed.

In fact, the main thing I have done during this period is backend things. The database I just showed you is in the development stage, and it is a local database. When it is actually released, where does it get the data? It gets it here. Let me show you, it is the database here. You see, it is exactly the same as the local one. You see, this is for development. This is for testing,that is, automatic testing, that is, every time you test, you have to delete all the data, and then automatically set some login data, session data, etc., each time it is new, and then you test whether the data it returns is correct and whether it is what you want. It is a database specifically used for testing. Then, after the final product is launched, the user data is stored here.

This is the database. The database stores the user's username, password, and pathname, and then there is email data. Then the real money is here, which stores some videos, pictures, PDFs, etc. I sell storage space, which is all stored here. Then, you can see that this is the bucket for development, this is the bucket for automatic testing, and the official one is this bucket. You can see that my structure has been improved. The user id is used as the folder name. All the contents of this user are stored in this folder. The user can modify the user name and path name. Where to set it? It is here in "Settings". This is also a dialog box that I will add next.

Then, by the way,basically, now each user has 200MB for free. I said 20GB before, which is too exaggerated. Then, I said 10 USD for 20GB per month, and then I thought about it, why not 10 cents for 200MB per month, which is actually the same, but much better. This is already a very attractive price. Then, if you pay by year, that is, for ten months, it is a preferential price. So this is a basic setting, which I think is pretty good.

Another thing is that the most time-consuming backend is Email. I use AWS's SES service. In order to verify the user's registered email address, I need to configure it to always maintain a connection with AWS's SES service. You can see here that I connect to SES every 30 minutes to avoid session expiration. This configurationis quite complex and took me a long time. You can see that everything works fine now with 0 errors.

Next, I will finish the automatic testing of mobile devices; then Markdown. The required parts should be added during the process.
